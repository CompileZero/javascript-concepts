// Micro-task = Callback functions returned from Promises and Mutation Observers
// Suppose a micro-task creates another micro-task, and so on... then the tasks in the callback queue do not get a chance to execute. This is called Starvation of that callback function.

// Immediately after a Macrotask is executed, JS will execute all the other microtasks in the queue, and then move on to the newer macrotasks.

// Microtasks = Jobs = Microtask Queue = JobQueue = Functions returned from Promises and Mutation Observers
// Macrotasks = Tasks = Task Queue = Callback Queue = All the other callback functions

// Thereâ€™s also a special function queueMicrotask(func) that queues func for execution in the microtask queue.
